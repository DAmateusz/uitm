    "description": "Jordan Brian Henderson (born 17 June 1990) is an English professional footballer who captains Premier League club Liverpool. He also plays for the England national team, and is usually deployed as a central midfielder for both club and country. However, due to his versatility, he has been known to fill other roles such as a right winger, right midfielder, right back and right wing-back.[4] He became the Liverpool vice-captain in 2014, and was then promoted to first team captain on 10 July 2015 after team mate Steven Gerrard left the club for LA Galaxy. He began his career at Sunderland in 2008, with a loan spell at Coventry City in 2009, before moving to Liverpool in 2011. In 2010, he won his first cap for England, having previously played for and captained the under-21 team. He has represented the country at UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.",
